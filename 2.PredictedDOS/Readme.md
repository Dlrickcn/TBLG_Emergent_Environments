Figure 3. (a) PTDOS of 2.13° rotated TBLG calculated from MD simulations vs. predicted from trained model. The mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) values which quantify the accuracy of the prediction are calculated in three regions of the frequency domain. (b) MAE and (c) MSE values for the same frequency domains are presented for 28 TBLG structures used in test set as histograms.
