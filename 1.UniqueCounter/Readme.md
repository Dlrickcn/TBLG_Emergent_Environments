Figure 2. The dependence of emerging types on the size of the supercell. The 140 investigated structures lie on two different nearly perfect lines. The slopes of the best fit lines are calculated as 0.167 and 0.0278 which correspond to 5.99 and 36.01 atoms in the cell per type respectively. Some randomly selected structures are also shown to point out the lack of any obvious visual pattern regarding the difference between two sets

This code has calculated unique local environments and space group of TBLG. The number of emergent types vs. the total number of atoms in each moiré supercell is presented in Figure.This method to 140 different moiré lattices, 34394 different types of atoms with different atomic environments are identified
