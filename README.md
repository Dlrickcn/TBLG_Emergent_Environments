Introduction
This project computationally analyses 140 different twisted bilayer superlattices using descriptor functions to study the emergent local environments. Our study reveals that the number of atoms with unique local environments depends on the superlattice size, linearly manifesting on two distinct lines by the respective space groups. We then introduce the use of local environments in investigating vibrational properties. The local phonon density of states of the atoms with unique local environments is calculated and used to train a machine learning model.
